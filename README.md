# json-test
A quick test project to check how the Jackson library converts string json to JsonNode objects

This is a quick exercise in TDD.

I needed to refactor some code to use a different library, but I needed to know how it worked to see if it was suitable for my needs.
It was also a good chance to try some TDD
